This project consist of writing my own assembly programme who is able to write in section .text an executable code (binary) for my custom machine.
I use the TCASM to write it. TCASM = turing_complete_assembly, its basically a very primitive asm that I already built.

The final programme will be named TASM.
An mini OS will be writen in tandem, the goal is to be able to handle the process with just one apk (the terminal) and
add commands into it like [cd, ls, mkdir, rm, find, chmod, grep..] and the flags [-d, -r, -f, -x..]
I started to write the TASM the 18/10/2025.
